## **Hi there!**

My nickname is Kei and I am (or willing to be) an independent android developer.


Some simple self-introductions:

- I have a side project called *LifeUp*, which is a gamification To-Do &
Habit Application and it's available in [the Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sarasarasa.lifeup).

- My main job is Android development, but I am also interested in product design, UI design, product operation, etc.

- Former ACMer and former English-to-Chinese Translators for some small game mods and Steam.

- I occasionally write articles in Chinese, both about programming, game culture, and more... and you can find them in my blog or my zhihu page.

- In addition, I also like reading, movies, anime, etc. One of my favorite games is "13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim".


If you want to communicate with me, please send me an email or add an "issue".
